Add a widget to help your readers build custom queries using drop-downs of your categories and custom taxonomies.

== Description ==

Taxonomy Picker is a widget which you can include in your sidebar to help visitors build complex queries using categories and your custom taxonomies by chosing terms from drop down boxes.  The widget also includes a text search making it easy to search for text only within certain categories or taxonomies.

Results will be displayed using your theme's standard search form so the results need no additonal styling.

For example on my site I use it to allow users to:

+ Find all posts containing the word Egypt within the Books category
+ Find all posts within the Magazine category which match "Valley of the Kings" in my "Where?" custom taxonomy which also include the word Tutankhamun
